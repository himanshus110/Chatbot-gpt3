The corpus of the Contingency Fund iscreated by debit to the Consolidated Fund ofIndia, and when expenditure is incurred out ofan advance from the Contingen cy Fund, theexpend iture is booked unde r the same headunder the ‘Contingency Fund’. Subsequent ly, with the regular izationof expend iture by obtaining vote of Parliament,the amount so advanced from Con tingen cyFund is recoupe d to the corpu s of theContingenc y Fund by debit to the ConsolidatedFund of India. The expenditure is then booke dinitially unde r the same head unde r theConsolidate d Fund of India , as revenue orcapita l expenditure, as the case may be.

As Ministries have delegatedtheir powers to lower functionaries, thebasic responsibility is shifted to theparticular functionary concerned, butoverall responsibility remains with theadministrative Ministry. A Grant or Appropriation can be utilisedonly to cover the charges (including liabilities, ifany, of the past year) which are to be paid duringthe financial year of the Grant or Appropriationand adjusted in the accounts of the year. Nocharges against a Grant or Appropriation canbe authorized after the expiry of the financialyear. No expenditure shall be incurred whichmay have the effect of exceeding the total grantor appropriation authorized by Parliament bylaw for a financial year, except after obtaininga supplementary grant or appropriation or anadvance from the Contingency Fund.

FEATURES OF BUDGET,"Budget preparation in India is an iterativeprocess between the Ministry of Finance andline Ministries/Departments. The process commences with the BudgetDivision in the Ministry of Finance issuing the‘Budget Circular’ detailing instructions forpreparing estimates. Some of the salient features of UnionBudget are as fol lows:a. Budge t is prepared on Cash Basis:Whatever is expected to be actuallyreceived or paid under proper sanctionduring a financial year (including arrearsof the past years) should be budgeted inthat year.b. Rule of Lapse:All appropriations granted by theParliament expire at the end of financialyear. Unspent budget are not availablefor meeting the demands in the nextfinancial year. Thus, all unutilized fundswithin the year ‘lapse’ at the end of thefinancial year.c. Realistic Estimation:It is essential that each Demand hasrealistic estimates which are required forexpenditure in that year.d. Budget to be on Gross/Net Basis:Budget is prepared both on gross basisand net basis. Departments/Ministriesare normally not permitted to utilize thereceipts or deduct expenditure in theirbudget proposals. Net basis of budgetingis done in case of some Grants e.g.Ministry of Railways, Department of Posts,etc., where the departmental receipts areallowed to be utilized.e. Form of Estimates to correspond toAccounts:It is essential that the form in the budgetestimates correspond to that ofGovernment accounts as it is from theseaccounts that the performance of theGovernment is jud ged and estimation forsubsequent year made.CHAPTER 1INTRODUCTION T O THE BUDGET2BUDGET MANUALf. Estimates to be on Departmental Basis:Every Department prepares estimates forreceipts and expenditure separately.Generally, one Demand or Grant isallocated in respect of each Ministry/Department. In case of certain largeDepartments/Ministries more than oneDemand for Grants is allocated."
FINANCE BILL,"Finance Bill is introduced by the FinanceMinister immediately after the Annual FinancialStatement is presented in the Lok Sabha. Beinga Money Bill, it is introduced in the Lok Sabhawith the President’s recommendation underclause (1) of Article 117. After passing of theAppropriation Bill, Finance Bill is considered andpassed by the Parliament. In the case of FinanceBill, the procedure in Rajya Sabha is the sameas in the case of other Money Bills. As the Finance Bill is a Secret Bill, copiesthereof are not circulated to the Members twodays in advance of its introduction as requiredunder Direction 19 of ‘Directions by the Speaker’. Introduction of the Finance Bill cannotbe opposed. Under the provisions of theProvisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1931, thisBill is required to be passed by both the Housesand receive assent of the President within 75days of its introduction. The Speaker has heldthat the Finance Bill should not containamendments to both direct and indirect tax lawsif they are of a permanent nature and are notconsequential upon or incidental to the taxationproposals, and for that, a separate Bill i.e.Taxation Laws Amendment Bill should bebrought forward. The provisions of the Bill relating toimposition of customs and central excise dutiescome into force immediately on the expiry ofthe day on which the Bill is introduced by virtueof declaration under the Provisional Collectionof Taxes Act, 1931, contained in the Bill to theeffect that it is expedient in the public interestthat the provisions of certain clauses of the Billshall have immediate effect. Such a provisionhas the force of law and it will have effect for75 days or till the date of enactment of theFinance Bill, whichever is earlier. Although there is no bar to theintroduction of more than one Finance Billcontaining taxation proposals in a year, yet if asecond Finance Bill containing supplementarytaxation proposals is introduced, it has to bepreceded by Demands for Grants and theconnected Appropriation Bill. In other words,the sequence in regard to Budget, as providedin Articles 112 to 115 of the Constitution has tobe followed."
FINANCE COMMISSION," Based on the recommendations of theFinance Commission from time to time, thebudget provisions for a year are made afterearmarking the States’ share, to work out theNet Tax Revenues of the Union Governmentfrom the Gross Tax Revenues."

The Finance Minister has a right to replyat the end of the discussions. The scope ofdiscussion at this stage is confined to generalexamination of the Budget, policy on taxationas expressed in the Budget Speech of the FinanceMinister and general schemes and structures etc.Specific points or issues can be discussed onthe floor of the House when relevant Demandsfor Grants or the Finance Bill is taken up. Officers not below the rank of UnderSecretaries are assigned to cover generaldiscussions on Budget and Finance Bill in boththe Houses of Parliament. They report importantpoints to their Heads of Divisions/Heads ofDepartments for preparing ‘Notes’ thereon.Such Notes are prepared promptly andsubmitted to the Finance Minister and should inno case be deferred to the following day if thediscussion is not concluded on that day. “Gistof Points” raised during the day are required tobe submitted to the Finance Minister. A specimenof the form to be used for submitting ‘Notes’ ispart of Annexure I of the Handbook ofParliamentary Procedure, issued by Ministry ofFinance. The Parliament Cell uploads theuncorrected version of verbatim record ofProceedings of both the Houses on the sameday or following day."
GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PREPARATION OF ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE,"Estimates of expenditure are required tobe furnished to Budget Division for pre- Budgetdiscussions. These discussions are normallyscheduled to commence around mid-Octoberto decide the net budgetary ceilings of eachMinistry/Department and are chaired bySecretary (Expenditure) . While formulating expenditure estimates,Ministries/Departments should review theexisting Expenditure Budget in the first instance,to prioritize the activities and schemes, andidentify those activities and schemes, which canbe eliminated or reduced in size or merged withany other scheme. Estimates of Ministries/Departments should conform to the projectionscontained in the MTEF Statement released byMinistry of Finance. Departments should ensure that allschemes that have been discontinued, do notfind mention in Revised Estimates of the currentyear. Similarly, schemes that are not to continuebeyond the current year should not be includedfor Budget Estimates of ensuing year. A mentionof the schemes discontinued or merged shouldbe made in the notes below the Statement ofBudget Estimates. Under standing instructions of thisMinistry, no provision should normally be madein the Budget without completion of pre-Budgetscrutiny/appraisal of a project/scheme. Where,however, provision has been made without thenecessary scrutiny, such scrutiny should becompleted and appropriate approvals obtained25BUDGET MANUALbefore the commencement of the financial yearand passing of Budget by the Parliament. While framing estimates, due note mayalso be taken of the past performance, thestages of formulation/implementation of thevarious schemes, the institutional capacity of theimplementing agencies to implement thescheme as scheduled, constraints on spendingby the spending agencies, and most importantly,the quantum of Government assistance lyingwith the recipients unutilized etc. with a view tominimize the scope for surrenders at a laterstage. The Public Accounts Committee requiresthat savings in a Grant amounting to `100 croreand above be explained to the Committee. Theother Parliamentary Committees have also beenrepeatedly expressing concern over incidenceof large savings in Grants. Budget Division has issued instructionson the need for individual Ministry/ Departmentto put in place effective mechanism forrealistically assessing their requirement of fundsso that unwarranted surrender of savings isavoided at a later date. No provision may be made in theestablishment Budget for posts, which are lyingvacant for one year or more. Even otherwise,provisioning for vacant posts should be madewith circumspection so as to avoid chances ofeventual savings due to these vacant posts notbeing filled up."

MERGER OF RAIL BUDGET WITH GENERAL BUDGET,"Merger of Railway Budget with GeneralBudget was one of the landmark budgetaryreforms implemented from the Budget forFY 2017-18. The presentation of separate Railwaybudget started in the year 1924, and continuedafter independence as a convention rather thanunder Constitutional provisions. Thepresentation of a unified budget is to bring theaffairs of the Railways to centre stage andpresent a holistic picture of the financial positionof the Government. The merger is expected toreduce the procedural requirements and insteadbring into focus, the aspects of delivery andgood governance. Consequent to the merger,the appropriations for Railways are, now, partof the main Appropriation Bill. The arrangements for merger of Railwaybudget with the General budget were approvedby the Cabinet with the following administrativeand financial arrangements:(i) The Railways continue to maintain itsdistinct entity as a departmentally runcommercial undertaking as at present;(ii) Railways retain their functional autonomyand delegation of financial powers etc.as per the existing guidelines;(iii) The existing financial arrangementscontinue wherein Railways meet all theirrevenue expenditure, including ordinaryworking expenses, pay and allowancesand pensions etc. from their revenuereceipts;(iv) The Capital at charge of the Railwayswas wiped off; and(v) Ministry of Railways get Gross Budgetarysupport towards meeting part of itscapital expenditure as in the past. A formal and public presentation ofrailway budget created pressure for large publicannouncements on introduction of new trainsand new projects without detailed analysis oftheir need or financial viability. With the merger of Railway Budget withGeneral Budget, the scrutiny of RailwayEstimates is made in Ministry of Finance during8BUDGET MANUALmid-year review with focus on optimal utilisationof resources and railway infrastructure withoutgetting into unbridled public announcements.This exercise also takes into account theperformance of Railways in the previous yearand during the current year for revising thetarget for revenue realisation and expenditureset in the budget. With this specific reform, the number ofDemands for Grants operated by Railways hasbeen reduced from 16 to 1.9BUDGET MANUAL"
MID-TERM EVALUATION OFINDIVIDUAL SCHEMES BY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS,"The Cabinet Secretary had advised(December, 2002) all the Ministries/Departments to carry out evaluation of all theongoing schemes/ programmes/ projects whichhave not been evaluated so far.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION,"Development Monitoring and EvaluationOffice (DMEO) as an apex Monitoring andEvaluation (M&E) office which supports theGovernment to achieve the nationaldevelopment agenda through M & E ofgovernment policies and programs. DMEO was established on 18thSeptember, 2015 as an attached office of theNITI Aayog by merging the erstwhile ProgramEvaluation Office and Independent EvaluationOffice. To ensure that DMEO is able to functionindependently, it has been given separate56BUDGET MANUALbudgetary allocations and manpower inaddition to complete functional autonomy. DMEO’s mandate involves;i. Monitoring progress and efficacy ofstrategic and long-term policy andprogram frameworks and initiatives tohelp innovative improvements, includingnecessary mid-course corrections; andii. Actively monitoring and evaluating theimplementation of programs andinitiatives, including the identification ofthe needed resources so as to strengthenthe probability of success and scope ofdelivery.iii. Technical advisory to States, under NITIAayog’s mandate of cooperative andcompetitive federalism."
NITI AAYOG," NITI Aayog (National Institution forTransforming India) came into existence on 1stJanuary, 2015 replacing erstwhile Planning17BUDGET MANUALCommission. NITI Aayog serves as a Think Tankof the Government, and provides Governmentsat the central and state levels with relevantstrategic and techinical advice across spectrumof key elements of policy. Apart from providingadvice on general policy matters, NITI Aayogalso helps in specific task of finalising OutputOutcome Monitoring Framework (OOMF)which brings out meassurable outputs andoutcomes of outlays made to difficult schemes."
Outcome Budget / Output-OutcomeMonitoring Framework (OOMF),"Major Expenditure Reforms havebeen undertaken by the Government over thelast few years. This not only includessimplification of appraisal and approvalprocesses, but also structural changes in theprocess of Budget making itself, like doing awaywith Plan and non-Plan etc..As a result, the cost-centres are being treated inan integrated manner, within only the statutoryrevenue capital framework. This enablesanother major structural reform, which is tobring the public schemes and projects under aMonitorable Output-Outcome Framework. Since 2017-18, in addition to the financialoutlays of schemes of the Ministries beingindicated in the Budget document, expectedoutputs and outcomes of Schemes are also beingpresented in a consolidated Outcome Budgetdocument, along with the Budget. These Outlays,Outputs and Outcomes are being presented to43BUDGET MANUALthe Parliament in measurable terms, bringing ingreater accountability for the agencies involvedin the execution of government schemes andprojects. Outlay is the amount that is providedfor a given scheme or project in the Budget .Output refers to the direct and measurableproduct of program activities, often expressed inphysical terms or units. Outcomes are thecollective results or qualitative improvementsbrought about by the delivery of these services. The document presented along withBudget contains Output-Outcome Frameworkfor major Central Sector (CS) Schemes andCentrallySponsored Schemes (CSS) with outlayof ` 500 crore and more. Output-Outcome Monitoring Framework(OOMF) shall be prepared as per the format(Appendix-XLVIII)circulated vide this Ministry’sD.O. letter No. 2(33)-B(P&A)/2018 dated 13thMay 2019. Ministries/Departments shall submitOOMF in the format to NITI Aayog (in Englishand Hindi). Necessary timeline for preparationand submission of OOMF shall be separatelycommunicated by the NITI Aayog to allMinistries/Departments. NITI Aayog shallfinalize the OOMF and forward the same toDepartment of Expenditure (PFC-II Division).DoE will review the targets of outputs andoutcomes with reference to budgeted outlay inconsultation with DMEO, NITI Aayog andforward the final document to Budget Division."
OUTCOME-OUTPUT MONITORINGFRAMEWORK (OOMF),"From the fiscal year 2006-07, OutcomeBudget has been a part of the budgetaryprocess, wherein every Ministry presents apreliminary Outcome Budget.

Budget Process,"The Budget process mainly consists oftwo types of activities: First, administrativeprocess, wherein the budget along withdocuments are prepared in consultation withvarious stakeholders; secondly, legislativeprocess wherein the Budget is passed byParliament after discussion. In this chapter, wewill discuss about the administrative process ofbudget preparation."
Union Budget Presentation,"Though Union Budget is presented on1st February or any other suitable date asdecided by the Government, the process ofBudget preparation commences in mid ofAugust of previous year and continues till theend of March. On the presumption that Budgetshall be presented at 11AM on 1st February orany other date as decided by the Government,the Budget Division prepares a comprehensiveSchedule for carrying out the Budget preparationactivities. The Schedule clearly indicates rolesand responsibilities of all the stakeholdersinvolved in the Budget preparation process."
UNION GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS,"Accounts are a systematic record ofvarious activities and functions expressed infinancial terms and maintained. The Constitution of India envisages theaccounts of the Union and the States to be keptin such a form as the President may on theadvice of the C&AG prescribe. Accounts of the Union Government areprepared annually showing the receipts anddisbursements for the year, surplus or deficitgenerated during the year and changes inGovernment liabilities and assets. The accounts shall be prepared byController General of Accounts, certified by theComptroller and Auditor General of India andalong with the report of the Comptroller andAuditor General of India on these accounts, shallbe submitted to the President of India, preferablywithin six months of close of the Financial Year,who shall cause them to be laid before eachHouse of Parliament. Major inputs provided by the accountingauthorities to the Government and Public are inthe form of -61BUDGET MANUALi. Monthly and Annual Accounts,ii. Finance Accounts, andiii. Appropriation Accounts. Record of transactions both receipts andexpenditure by various paying and accountingauthorities are consolidated by Ministries/Departments on a monthly basis. These arerendered to the Controller General of Accountsto generate the accounts of the Government ofIndia as a whole on a monthly basis andreleased. Monthly Account provides an analysisof expenditure, revenue collection, borrowingsand deficit. These are on net basis. Finance Accounts of Government ofIndia (including transactions of Department ofPosts and Ministries of Defence and Railwaysand transactions under Public Account of Indiaof Union Territory Governments), reflect underrespective Heads the annual receipts anddisbursements and statement of balances forthe purpose of the Union. Finance Accountscomprises of two parts- Part I and Part II. Part Ipresents the summarized statements in respectof Revenue, Capital, Debt, Deposit, Suspenseand Remittances transactions and ContingencyFund, while Part II has detailed statements inrespect of these transactions, along with otherrelated statements. The Finance Accounts aresimilar to Annual Financial Statement and thereceipts are net of refunds and expenditure arenet of recoveries. Union Government FinanceAccounts do not make fiscal adjustments. Appropriation Accounts reflect theexpenditure, voted and charged, of theGovernment for each financial year comparedwith the amounts of the voted grants andappropriations charged for different purposesas specified in the schedules appended to theAppropriation Acts. Appropriation accounts areon gross basis, without any kind of adjustments. FEATURES OF ACC OUNTING SYSTEM Government accounts in India are kepton cash basis. All appropriations lapse at theclose of the financial year. Only actual receiptsand payments during the year are taken intoaccount with no outstanding liabilities or incometo be accrued included. Both receipts and payments aredifferentiated and classified in detai l. Uniformclassification upto Minor Head level enablesfinancia l comparisons between Union and StateGovernment. In case of those GovernmentDepartments where functions are purely orlargely of a comm ercial nature, their accountsare maintained on commercial basis (onmodified accrual accounting principles). Theseaccounts are subs idiary to principal accounts. For major government commercialdepartments-such as Railways, and Postsdetailed capital and revenue accounts areprepared and presented separately. This enablespresentation of true financial position, cost ofservices rendered and the return frominvestments. Government Accounts have necessarilyto comply with the budgetary structure of thecountry. Since Budgets in India are on an annualbasis, governmental transactions are alsofinalized in the accounts on an annual basis."
VOTE ON ACCOUNT," A provision has been made in theConstitution which empowers Lok Sabha tomake any grant in advance in respect of theestimated expenditure for a part of the f inancialyear pending completion of procedure for thevoting of the Demands.
